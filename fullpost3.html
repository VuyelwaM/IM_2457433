            <h1>The Power of Data Visualization: Enhancing Communication through Interaction</h1>
            <p>We humans are visual creatures, few of us can detect patterns among rows of numbers, but even children can interpret bar charts and extract meaning from those numbers' visual representation. And for that reason, data visualization is a powerful exercise and the  fastest way to communicate it to others. (Murray, 2013)  In this essay, I will be reflecting on the interaction on data visuals and how it is defined. This essay does not intend to redefine interaction but rather give the different ways researchers tried to define it. In Perlin and Dimara’s article on What is interaction for data visualization, a quest to define interaction is reported in their article and the  main focus is finding a solid definition  because they say interaction “in the context of visualization is ambiguous and confusing and argue that this confusion is due to a lack of consensual definition.” (Perlin, Dimara, 2020) The two researchers take on steps to assist them in finding a definition but closely separate definitions they could find from the visualization community and the human-computer interact community.

            <h1>Methodology: Unveiling the Dimensions of Interaction in Visualization Research</h1>
            <p>The methodology employed in the research involved a critical review approach due to the vastness of the interaction topic in visualization. Critical reviews aim to highlight the most significant elements in a field, avoiding the need for an exhaustive review. Three key requirements were set: the inclusion of expert input to understand the community's view of interaction, avoiding bias in the selection of papers through a snowballing approach, and ensuring the review focused specifically on visualization and not stray into unrelated human-computer-interact papers.

                Two metrics were used to measure a paper's impact and relevance: ImpactP, evaluating importance based on citations, and RelevanceP, assessing its pertinence to interaction. Inclusion criteria were set to maintain a balance between relevance and avoiding false negatives. An online form was sent to visualization researchers, collecting data on definition and relevant papers, years of visualization experience, and interaction focus in their own papers.

            <h1>The Role of Interactivity in Modern Data Visualization: Enhancing Engagement, Understanding, and Collaboration</h1>
            <p>In the growing era of technology and digital spaces, people have moved beyond traditional approaches to interpreting data. Users, researchers, and programmers now seek new, advanced, and convenient ways to engage with data. Interaction plays a pivotal role in data visualization, offering a more enjoyable method to analyse and gather data. Beyond this, interactivity significantly enhances understanding and insights into complex datasets by allowing dynamic exploration and manipulation. Users can uncover real-time insights, identify trends, and make well-informed decisions by directly interacting with visualized data. Moreover, interactivity enables personalization and tailored experiences, allowing users to customize their interaction based on preferences and specific needs. This personalized engagement enhances user satisfaction and fosters a sense of control over the displayed information. Lastly, interactivity facilitates communication and collaboration, providing a common platform for teams to collectively explore and discuss data, leading to more comprehensive and accurate analyses. Interactivity does not only draw in previously unengaged audiences but also empowers users to derive deeper insights and collaborate effectively in the data analysis process.

            <h1>The Essence of Interaction in Visualization: Understanding Properties, Perspectives, and Challenges in Web Design and Data Programming</h1>
            <p>The article primarily focuses on defining interaction, viewing it as a real-time action with a clear start and end, expecting immediate responses from the visualization system. (Perlin, Dimara, 2020) The article delves into the advantages and criticisms of interaction, particularly highlighting the shift in focus from designing towards building, which emphasizes enhancing technology rather than ensuring its user-friendliness. It also discusses specific properties of interaction within visualization, emphasizing its granularity, discreteness, and directness. Furthermore, the article explores interaction characteristics from the perspective of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), such as dialogue, transmission, and control. Lastly, it distinguishes interaction in visualization from human-computer interaction, highlighting differences in nature of intent and performance.

                When you get into the business of making programming and web designing your passion or centre of work life I don’t think anyone ever prepares you for the nit and gritty stuff you have to consider when making a website or even building interactive data.

            <h1>Balancing Aesthetics and Functionality: Critiquing Interactivity and Embracing Diverse Approaches in Web Design and Data Programming</h1>
            <p>Getting deep into the critiques of interactivity as mentioned in the article, as programmers we all are guilty of focusing more on the aesthetically pleasing visuals and forget that we have users with different understanding ability and knowledge of the web at large. There is also a huge issue of being too focused on one way of interacting with data, it is more than just clicking and touching, the article says we should consider touch and voice, and it goes on to say that interactivity also should involve  system centric approaches where the focus might be on the various functions or operators within the application, user centric considerations where interactivity advances to giving user options, for instance if they are using a weather map, a option on whether they want the data in Celsius of ferenheigt, whether users are more interested in the forecast for the day or the entire week, providing intuitive ways for users to switch between different locations or cities. Another critique highlighted is that there is no balance between technical and user needs, this critique underscores the importance of finding the right balance between ensuring a technology functions effectively and aligning it with users' preferences and satisfaction. It highlights the need to harmonize technical excellence with an intuitive and enjoyable user experience for a successful and widely embraced product.
                Reflecting on interaction properties in visualization, it's evident that granularity plays a key role, encompassing various levels from small actions like clicks to larger activities like hypothesis generation. The interplay of continuous and discrete interactions, each with distinct characteristics, adds complexity. Additionally, the concept of directness in interaction has evolved, from rapid actions on data representations to the use of intermediate widgets, highlighting the need to consider a spectrum of directness rather than a binary classification. These emphasize the intricate nature of interaction in visualization.

            <h1>Understanding Interaction in Human-Computer Interface: Unpacking Characteristics and Dimensions</h1>
            <p>The article doesn’t go into the human-computer interaction definition in detail, but they do share characteristics involved in interactivity, dialogue, a prominent concept, and envisions interaction as a communicative cycle involving input and output, emphasizing directness, simplicity, and understanding. Transmission views interaction as an information exchange, seeking to maximize error-free information transfer. Control, drawing from control theory, frames interaction as continuous goal-driven actions aiming to minimize errors and converge efficiently to user goals. Tool use sees interaction as utilizing tools to mediate between the user and the system, enhancing user capabilities. Optimal behaviour defines interaction as adaptive behavior under various constraints, emphasizing optimal adaptation of cognitive processes within given user capabilities. Embodiment views interaction as an extension of the user, incorporating the technology into their experience seamlessly. Lastly, experience highlights the role of user expectations and momentary reactions, focusing on aesthetics and usability. (Perlin, Dimara, 2020)

            <h1>Expanding Perspectives: Rethinking Data Interaction in Website Design</h1>
            <p>This article has significantly enriched my comprehension, not only by providing a clear definition of interactivity but also by prompting me to rethink my approach to website development. It has illuminated the fact that interaction extends beyond crafting the perfect user experience and user interface. We must integrate considerations about what precisely the user requires, how they may utilize the platform, and what their specific needs entail. This broader perspective implies that we should not adopt a narrow-minded approach when it comes to data interaction in website design.
                The article triggered a sense of urgency, reminding me that when presenting data interactively, it's not only essential to ensure the data is meaningful and easily manageable, but also that the interactivity isn't arbitrary. Techniques like zooming or clicking should serve a purpose. Furthermore, the interactivity should harmonize effectively with the nature of the data. For instance, displaying weather intensity using a scatter plot or a line graph is appropriate, while a pie chart wouldn't convey the information effectively. This realization served as a profound revelation, shaping my perspective on interactive data presentation.
                In conclusion, I have discussed the procedure Perlin and Dimara took to define a solid definition for interactivity and what was uncovered was that the definition works differently in different fields, Interaction in visualization refers to the ways in which users engage with and manipulate visual representations of data to gain insights and explore patterns. 
                
                Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), on the other hand, is a broader field encompassing the study, design, and evaluation of the interaction between humans and computer systems. It includes understanding how users interact with technology, the design of user interfaces, usability testing, and the overall user experience.
